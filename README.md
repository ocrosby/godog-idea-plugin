Godog Idea Plugin
=======================

IntelliJ IDEA / GoLand plugin for [godog BDD testing](https://github.com/cucumber/godog)

While searching for a Cucumber / Gherkin plugin for GoLand, I noticed that I couldn't find one that was targeted at
GoLand so I decided to write one.  This repo contains a Godog plugin intended for GoLand.

What does it do?
